# BMDL

BMDL is a fork of [Daemonite's Material](http://daemonite.github.io/material/), a cross-platform and fully responsive front-end interface based on __Google Material Design__. This lightweight framework is built using __Bootstrap 4__. The basic idea behind this project is to combine the visual language of Google Material Design with the front-end technology of the popular Bootstrap framework to allow for rapid prototyping and serve as a library for our components.

> A visual language for our users that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science. This is material design.
> http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html

Detailed [documentation site](http://moconnor-bmj.github.io/) is work in progress. Please let us know what you think.

## Goals

### Primary

The primary goal of this project is to give all Bootstrap components and elements a Material Design look, so it allows web developers to continue using the exact same Bootstrap HTML markup they are familiar with, but presents them a final outcome that is in line with the principles and specifics of Google Material Design.

Therefore, the Bootstrap's [documentation](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/introduction/) can serve as a valid documentation for this project as well. Replacing `bootstrap.min.css` on the site with `material.min.css` from this project without any other changes will transform all components and elements into a materialised look.

### Secondary

A secondary goal of this project is to add support of some unique Material Design components such as floating action buttons, pickers and steppers, to name a few, which cannot be achieved by transforming existing Bootstrap components or elements.

Because these components will require additional markup (some may require additional JavaScript), they will be documented separately in Material's documentation (work-in-progress).

## Supported Bootstrap 4 Components

Currently based on __Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.6__.
